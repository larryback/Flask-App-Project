1
00:00:08,443 --> 00:00:09,966
Previously on Star Trek: Discovery...

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,360
With the
Enterprise in Spacedock,

3
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,275
Captain Pike and Discovery's mission

4
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,190
to find any rational explanation

5
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:17,930
for the seven signals
continues to escape me.

6
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,584
And with it, perhaps, any chance

7
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,456
of a relationship with my brother Spock.

8
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:24,937
Computer, show me Starfleet's
rendering of the seven signals.

9
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,200
Spock drew these signals

10
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,202
two months before they appeared to us.

11
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,681
It's damn near identical.

12
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,555
Amanda?

13
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,470
I stole
Spock's medical file.

14
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,559
I've been waiting for an
update on my officer, Spock.

15
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,430
Your guy is wanted for murder.

16
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:41,563
Killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

17
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:44,000
I thought that he
had left it in the past,

18
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,610
but it's back.

19
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:48,613
- What is it?
- Your brother called it the Red Angel.

20
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,572
That vision changed him forever.

21
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,226
It wasn't because of a vision.

22
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:55,403
- It was because of me.
- What did you do?

23
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,404
I will find him.

24
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:58,232
No.

25
00:00:58,275 --> 00:01:00,147
I will.

26
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,498
Got it.

27
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,934
After the dark matter hit me...

28
00:01:04,977 --> 00:01:07,763
- It's me.
- I started to see a ghost.

29
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,852
Her name was May, but she's dead. Tilly.

30
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:11,984
- I am losing, Michael.
- You don't need sickbay.

31
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,812
- You need Stamets.
- We should have results

32
00:01:13,856 --> 00:01:15,118
- in one second.
- There he is.

33
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:17,251
That's the captain.
That's where he flies.

34
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,774
Just as I suspected.

35
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:21,733
- You are hosting a eukaryotic organism.
- A fungus?

36
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,996
This might hurt a bit.

37
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:32,657
Security breach by unknown
alien species in Engineering.

38
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,834
Engage quarantine protocol Alpha-Omega.

39
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,840
Energize.

40
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,103
Teleporter incoming.

41
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,770
- Captain.
- Welcome aboard Discovery, Number One.

42
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,338
The failures cascaded
through all our primaries.

43
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,124
Helm, nav, both impulse and
warp drive. Chief Louvier

44
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,082
has an engineering team
working 'round the clock.

45
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,476
I don't think Enterprise will
ever have a chief engineer

46
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,825
more in love with his ship.

47
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,479
Apparently, Enterprise is the only ship

48
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:13,002
in the fleet that's had any problems.

49
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:14,134
You know, he warned me.

50
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,657
The damn holographic comm system.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,180
Tell Louvier to rip
out the entire system.

52
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,616
From now on we'll communicate

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,052
using good, old-fashioned view screens.

54
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,663
Truth is I never liked the holograms.

55
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,491
They look too much like ghosts.

56
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,667
He told you I'd say that.

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,799
No. I told him.

58
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:30,584
Cheeseburger. Fries.
Habanero sauce.

59
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,674
You want to order some
lighter fluid with that?

60
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:33,675
That goes with the shake.

61
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,199
Sorry to keep you in Spacedock.

62
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,635
I've made use of the time, Captain.

63
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,464
You've been looking into the
allegations against Spock.

64
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:42,858
It's hard to comprehend,
let alone believe,

65
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,642
that he murdered three people

66
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:47,297
at the psychiatric
facility on Starbase Five.

67
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,342
How's the crew taking it?

68
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,908
They don't know the details.

69
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,432
Only that he's in trouble.

70
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,349
There's something else.

71
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,394
Tell me.

72
00:02:57,438 --> 00:03:01,703
Starfleet's classified
his case Level One.

73
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:04,184
Line officers don't usually
warrant that kind of scrutiny.

74
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,838
It's unprecedented. Which is
why I've done a little digging.

75
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:08,100
Sanctioned?

76
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,190
Better you don't know
the answer to that.

77
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,322
Before I look at that,

78
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:15,717
I need to know why you saw fit
to detour Federation protocols.

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,329
Something about this
investigation isn't adding up.

80
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,897
I'm not letting him go without a fight.

81
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,204
As usual, we agree.

82
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,597
Captain Pike to the ready room.

83
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,687
I'm late for a briefing.
I'm glad you came.

84
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,254
I'm sorry you can't stay longer.

85
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,256
Next time.

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,866
Be careful, Captain.

87
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,217
You, too, Number One.

88
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:46,051
We should give it a name.

89
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,792
Other than May.

90
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:52,101
I know it looks like a blob,

91
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,277
but this is one of the most
sophisticated life-forms

92
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:55,800
I've ever encountered.

93
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:58,890
It has sentience, intention.

94
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:02,285
Tilly, the mycelial network
doesn't just connect life.

95
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,113
It contains it.

96
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,506
It's an incubator.

97
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,813
You mean, like, um... like a home?

98
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:17,257
I've been wondering why
it appeared to me as May,

99
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,867
which got me thinking about the real May

100
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,825
that I met when I was, um, 14.

101
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,439
I was, um... I was a weird kid.

102
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:27,963
You know?
Like, not a lot of friends

103
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:31,967
and nobody who really
believed in me, including me.

104
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,753
But... she did.

105
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:40,323
She wanted to connect to
me, and she tried so hard.

106
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:42,107
But I don't really think

107
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:43,805
I was the friend to her that she needed.

108
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,415
I'm certain

109
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,983
you were much kinder than
you give yourself credit for.

110
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,333
You always are.

111
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,770
Thank you, but...

112
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,252
I didn't even know she died.

113
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,080
I feel like I took her for granted.

114
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,952
That girl who thought I was special.

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,172
Oh!

116
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:10,222
I've cross-referenced what
we're calling the Red Angel

117
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:11,485
with all known winged

118
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,356
and avian life-forms in the Federation.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,662
So far, I've found nothing.

120
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,882
Sorry.

121
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,668
The universal translator
sometimes has trouble

122
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,192
reconfiguring my
lingual clicks and pops.

123
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:26,500
My answer to you was, "Nothing
in the known universe. "

124
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,502
Which might suggest it's not a species.

125
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,374
- Maybe one of a kind.
- A mutation.

126
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,376
Well, whatever it is,
figuring out how it's connected

127
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,726
to these signals will
help us identify it.

128
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,076
If only we knew what it needs.

129
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,689
Commander Nhan, USS Enterprise.

130
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:42,864
Glad to be here.

131
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,387
Welcome back aboard.

132
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,867
Could you pass the salt?

133
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,695
Commander Saru,

134
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,392
can you shed any light?

135
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,394
My apologies.

136
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,396
I woke up this morning fighting

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,050
an acute rhino virus.

138
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,225
So you have a cold.

139
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:59,750
I had a cold last week, which sucked.

140
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,928
Saurian. Six nasal canals.

141
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,930
It happens to the best of us, Linus.

142
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,932
Everyone to your stations.
Detmer, set a course

143
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,500
for 108 mark four. Maximum warp.

144
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:11,675
Aye, sir.

145
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,895
Mr. Saru, you look like hell.

146
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,331
You've been burning the
candle at both ends lately.

147
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,419
Go get some rest.

148
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,682
As you wish, sir.

149
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:22,425
Burnham. A word.

150
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:26,647
I understand your first officer
is on her way to Spacedock.

151
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,649
Was her visit informative?

152
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,302
Number One is very resourceful.

153
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:33,131
People have a tendency to
end up owing her favors.

154
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,264
She uncovered

155
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:37,484
some classified information

156
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,702
on Starbase Five.

157
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,139
That is the warp
signature of the shuttle

158
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,359
that Spock stole from
the psychiatric facility.

159
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,622
I put us on an intercept course.

160
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,495
We should reach his position
in the next few hours.

161
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,284
S- Sir,

162
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,765
after everything that's happened,

163
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:01,508
I need to excuse myself
from seeing Spock.

164
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,423
Not sure I follow.

165
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,642
I don't want to make
things worse for him.

166
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:10,473
He's a fugitive, whatever
the circumstances.

167
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,346
And as Amanda suggested...

168
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,610
I'm probably the last person

169
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,482
who should insert
themselves into this problem.

170
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:22,746
I disagree. He is lost, Captain.

171
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,184
You are better suited to help him.

172
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,014
I've thought this through.

173
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:34,497
Please, trust me.

174
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,500
My abiding trust in you

175
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,155
doesn't eclipse the mission at hand.

176
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,026
Facing whatever happened to Spock,

177
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,289
it's not gonna be easy for any of us.

178
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,206
Reaching him has to be the priority.

179
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,039
Detmer, status?

180
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,650
Something has grabbed
us out of warp, sir.

181
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,216

00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,177
are we talking tractor beam?

185

Okay, there's more where that came from.

311
00:16:09,533 --> 00:16:11,579
We've got a hundred-
giga-electron volts

312

313
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:13,343
Computer's isolated the compartment

314
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,345

315
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:17,434

316
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,436

317
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,744
If our oxygen ignites,
we'll cook like french fries.

318
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,920
Well, we could divert
the power to act like a...

319
00:16:24,963 --> 00:16:26,965
- a-a lightning arrestor.
- We could use the door

320
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,663
as a ground.

321
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:31,274
Then the surge would
dissipate through the frame

322
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:33,537
of the ship. The question is,

323
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:36,627
how do we conduct the
surge from there to there?

324
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,586
No, a gas could, once it ionizes.

325
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,675
I infuse the spores with
an argon-xenon mixture

326
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:42,459
to slow decay.

327
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:44,461
We could link up the canisters

328
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,550

version of a lightning rod.

331
00:16:50,598 --> 00:16:53,122

339
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,655

Uh, yeah, 'cause obviously you're not.

00:18:02,495 --> 00:18:03,584
she won't let go!

359
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:04,541
She won't let go.

360
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,881
What's happening to him?

361
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,970
I'm hoping Dr. Pollard can tell us.

362
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:25,278
Well, comms is down, so I need
to see what the situation is

363
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,149
in sickbay, anyway.

364
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,498
Triage plasma
burns on level one.

365
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,196
Send non-critical to sickbay two.

366
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,197
Doctor.

367
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,981
Bring him here.

368
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:36,158
Elevated heart rate,

369
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:37,507
spiking adrenal levels,

370
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:39,205
increased neural activity.

371
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:42,033
The pain would render the
average humanoid unconscious.

372
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,515
What do we do about those?

373
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,996
Nothing. It is an effect of...

374
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,693
my condition.

375
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,482
Ocular discomfort?

376
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,527
No. Kelpiens can see far deeper

377
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,703
into Th-the light spectrum than humans.

378
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:02,010
I keep seeing flashes
of ultraviolet light,

379
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,533
invisible to you,
but... quite the opposite

380
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,013
for me. Are these symptoms

381
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,362
common among Kelpiens?

382
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,669
This is pointless. And the ship is being

383
00:19:08,712 --> 00:19:11,150
further immobilized as we waste time.

384
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,456
There is no reason to believe
the sphere is benevolent.

385
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,979
Now, please...

386
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,067
Commander.

387
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:18,635
Dr. Pollard is trying to help you.

388
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:25,642
Yes. It is unique to my people,

389
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,905
and it is terminal.

390
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,912
Are you certain?

391
00:19:34,956 --> 00:19:37,350
I have never been more
certain of anything in my life.

392
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,786
When I awoke

393
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,353
in discomfort this morning...

394
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:45,793
I hoped it was just... a passing cold.

395
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,883
But now I have to face the truth.

396
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,494
I do not understand why...

397
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,192
but I am beginning to think that

398
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,150
the sphere is... is triggering

399
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,892
the Kelpien biological
process known as...

400
00:19:57,935 --> 00:20:00,199
Vahar'ai.

401
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,897
It is the event that signals

402
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,205
when Kelpiens are ready to be...

403
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:10,296
culled for slaughter by... the Ba'ul,

404
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,733
the predator species on my homeworld

405
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:13,995
of Kaminar.

406
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,040
But there are no Ba'ul here.

407
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,217
It does not matter.

408
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,306
Kelpien ganglia only enflame

409
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,006
in this manner... as we near our end.

410
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,573
I am a...

411
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,836
a slave to my biology.

412
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,926
We are not gonna let you die.

413
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,276
There has to be something

414
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,756
that we can do.

415
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,497
There is not.

416
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,151
Kelpiens undergoing Vahar'ai

417
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:42,893
either die in the culling

418
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:46,854
or... are driven to
madness by the effects

419
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,769
of Vahar'ai. Either way,

420
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,815
death is inevitable.

421
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,646
The mycelial entity
has attached itself to Tilly.

422
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,692
We're trying to free her.
Engineering to bridge.

423
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:01,651
Engineering to bridge. Come in.

424
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,262
Comms are down.

425
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,480
Along with most of the ship.

426
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,399
Don't feel bad.

427
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,272
I know you have to
keep me in quarantine.

428
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,925
Or us.

429
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,319
I feel a little weird.

430
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:19,278
I should...

431
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,976
I should be terrified, but I'm not.

432
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,109
May means me no harm.

433
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,198
Are you able to see May again?

434
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:29,636
How do you know this is benign?

435
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,334
May was scary, and she
was clingy, and she,

436
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:34,684
like, never shut up, but...

437
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,512
she never hurt me.

438
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:39,036
She said she had a plan for me.

439
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,517
She said that I was her only chance.

440
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,693
Did you ever think she
was manipulating you?

441
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,000
That's what she said you were
doing... she said that you...

442
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,045
you were trying to
poison me against her.

443
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,439
Okay, if that thing wasn't
freaking me out, she is.

444
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,050
The blob seems to be secreting
a psilocybin hallucinogen

445
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,661
to influence her emotions.

446
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:55,618
So you're saying

447
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:56,706
she's on a bad trip?

448
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,055
Or maybe it's just trying

449
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,449
to calm her down so she won't be scared.

450
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,712
Or so she won't fight back?

451
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,546
If Saru thinks
that somehow the...

452
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,636
the sphere triggered Vahar'ai,

453
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,943
maybe escaping its grip would
stop what's happening to him.

454
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:17,248
The problem is freeing ourselves

455
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,815
before it destroys the ship.

456
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:20,991
If it wanted to destroy
us, why the slow attack?

457
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,776
It's inefficient, right?

458
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,430
It must need something.

459
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,823
It's taking what it needs.
Without the computer,

460
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:30,131
all our primary systems begin
to fail, including the warp core.

461
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,481
The EPS grid's unstable,
and it's cutting off

462
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,092
entire sections, including Engineering.

463
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,268
Life support's down to
60%, but who's counting?

464
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,402
It is not logical for a
virus to kill its host.

465
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:43,362
You're attaching a known medical
diagnosis to an unknown entity.

466
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,928
There may be a way to...

467
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,190
slow the virus.

468
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,628
If we can analyze its properties,

469
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:52,414
we may be able to develop
digital antibodies.

470
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,677
That could give us back enough
control to break the ship free.

471
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,591
In theory, but it will be

472
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:57,288
a slow process, like...

473
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:59,769
army ants eating a water buffalo.

474
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,684
I'm on it. Going to the science lab.

475
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,120
You will need my help.

476
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,427
Saru, Commander
Burnham can handle this.

477
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:08,387
There's no reason to risk
your health any further.

478
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,824
I am dying, Captain...

479
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:14,480
but I am most certainly not... dead.

480
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:22,792
The antibodies

481
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,273
are s-slowing the virus's progress.

482
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:28,842
Life support at 47%.

483
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:34,891
You are wondering why
I kept this from you.

484
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,855
You don't have to bear it alone.

485
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:45,815
How...

486
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,122
do I explain...

487
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,429
to the woman who has fought

488
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,433
over and over for the right
to take her next breath

489
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:59,350
that I come from a race that submits?

490
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,396
I'm your friend.

491
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,314
There will never be judgment between us.

492
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,577
Well, to my shame...

493
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,927
hiding is my nature.

494
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,064
I have learned multiple languages,

495
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,501
yet never shared my own,

496
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:23,070
fearful of revealing my own...

497
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,202
alienness.

498
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,032
May I...

499
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:31,034
request a favor?

500
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,080
Of course.

501
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,038
Anything.

502
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:38,694
I have kept detailed personal logs

503
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:41,262
since joining Starfleet.

504
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,699
I would ask you...

505
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:47,050
to officially catalogue
them, so that when...

506
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:51,402
General Order 1 no longer
applies to the Kelpiens...

507
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:54,405
they will know a journey like mine...

508
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,929
is possible.

509
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:58,627
It
would be my privilege.

510
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,111
Did you record your
life before Starfleet?

511
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:06,896
Uh, you might say my life began

512
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,944
when I was granted refugee
status by the Federation.

513
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:14,164
While being processed
at Starbase Seven...

514
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:19,039
...I saw for the first time

515
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:23,696
life-forms from across the universe,

516
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:26,568
some with less than I had,

517
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:29,832
yet, with a dream

518
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:31,965
of something better.

519
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,969
I listened.

520
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:42,062
Every story I heard...

521
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:45,500
...created... a space inside me

522
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,069
to feel more, to...

523
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,724
love more.

524
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:56,467
I joined Starfleet

525
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,774
to help those in need

526
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,864
the way I was helped.

527
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:03,910
You are...

528
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,086
the most empathic soul...

529
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,131
I know.

530
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,746
There was just one...

531
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:16,575
painful caveat to my signing up.

532
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,146
I
could never return home.

533
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,148
Why?

534
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:27,150
Oh.

535
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,152
More flashes of ultraviolet light.

536
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,633
They are... growing

537
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,157
in... strength and frequency.

538
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:36,638
- I'll get something from sickbay.
- No. No.

539
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,510
I will be fine.

540
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,164
The captain asked you

541
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,514
to return to the bridge
as soon as possible.

542
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,039
I can continue the work here.

543
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,346
Spock is still
at maximum warp, Captain.

544
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,174
If we're stuck here much
longer, we're going to lose him.

545
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:52,175
Reallocate power from the transporters

546
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,612
to long-range sensors.

547
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,961
I don't want to lose
contact with his shuttle.

548
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:56,658
Even with sensors at
max, we won't be able

549
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:58,660
- to track him for much longer.
- Contact Engineering.

550
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,662
See if they can reroute
impulse power to the deflectors.

551
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,664
If we can raise
shields, we might be able

552
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,666
to disrupt the stasis field
just enough to break free.

553
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,276
If so, can we jump away?

554
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,148
Negative, sir. We
don't have enough power

555
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,889
to create the necessary hull cavitation.

556
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,673
Comms are still down
in Engineering, sir.

557
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,066
Security protocols are
also malfunctioning,

558
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:14,676
locking off parts of the ship.

559
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,069
How are we doing, Commander?

560
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,548
The digital antibodies
are doing their job,

561
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:18,898
but progress is sluggish.

562
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,682
I'm running out of options.

563
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,293
If we lose Spock, we lose
any chance of protecting him.

564
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,295
Permission to go to Engineering.

565
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,775
We can't talk to them here, but maybe

566
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:28,298
I can help them get power to shields.

567
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:29,735
Permission granted.

568
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,877
- What's wrong?
- The doors won't open,

569
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,315
- and that thing reattached itself to Tilly.
- Can you detach it?

570
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,709
I could cut it off. She
wouldn't even lose a freckle.

571
00:27:46,753 --> 00:27:48,232
Bad idea.

572
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:51,148
If it's a symbiote,
removing it might kill her.

573
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,759
Well, thanks for stopping by.

574
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:55,239
I came to see if we can find a
way to boost power to shields.

575
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:56,588
No. With the systems fluctuating,

576
00:27:56,632 --> 00:27:57,938
this section is partitioned off.

577
00:27:57,981 --> 00:27:59,330
We can't get to the warp core.

578
00:27:59,374 --> 00:28:00,941
Michael...

579
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:08,383
I feel really tired.

580
00:28:08,426 --> 00:28:09,427
What is happening?

581
00:28:09,471 --> 00:28:10,646
That blob is sending her

582
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,952
in and out of consciousness.

583
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:13,605
Why is it doing that to her?

584
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:15,869
It's not like we can ask it.

585
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:17,958
Actually, we can.

586
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:21,222
This is a harmonic interface.

587
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:23,093
It-it links my neurons
to the mycelial network.

588
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,791
With modification,

589
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,663
it could link May to Tilly's
central nervous system.

590
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,100
Let May speak using Tilly's mouth.

591
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,276
Wait. What did you say?

592
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,713
We're gonna talk to it.

593
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,671
We need it to tell us what it wants.

594
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,412
So do we.

595
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,762
The sphere... it's been
trying to tell us something,

596
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,721
and we haven't been listening.

597
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,418
Well, damn, woman, go!We got her.

598
00:28:45,854 --> 00:28:47,464
Saru,

599
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,815
could the sphere be
trying to talk to us?

600
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:52,774
Using the virus as a way
to make first contact?

601
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:05,265
Yeah. Yes, of course.
I've been so blind.

602
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:11,706
The ultraviolet wavelengths
are repeating, like...

603
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,360
like letters would in...

604
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,536
in a sentence... everywhere.

605
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:18,017
Okay, Saru. Saru, stop. You're
hurting yourself.

606
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,888
No, no. No.

607
00:29:19,932 --> 00:29:22,021
You called me an "empathic soul,"

608
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,892
and it is true. My ganglia

609
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,155
respond to shifts in my environment,

610
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,722
like an early-warning system.

611
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,419
So it is... it is no coincidence

612
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:33,206
that I started feeling
sick just before...

613
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,164
the sphere engaged us.

614
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,210
- Why would...?
- I know what it is trying to say.

615
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:39,778
Not first contact, Burnham.

616
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,084
Last contact.

617
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:45,218
I think it came to us to die.

618
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:56,490
May?

619
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:57,926
Still me.

620
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,319
Signal's piss-poor.

621
00:29:59,362 --> 00:30:00,581
We need to amplify it.

622
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,756
Cortical implant.

623
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,411
What, you're talking about trepanation?

624
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:06,979
Drilling a hole in her skull? Yeah.

625
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,111
Are you gonna fix her
up with duct tape after?

626
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,287
Maybe. Commander?

627
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:12,375
I think she's right.

628
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,336
And I think you think that, too.

629
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,512
Then we do this together.

630
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,471
This is all I had laying around.

631
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,126
Please tell me you have a laser scalpel.

632
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,998
No. We're gonna do this old-school.

633
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,651
We need to sterilize that drill bit.

634
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,697
First aid kit's over there.

635
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,532
I was able to raise shields.

636
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:39,881
We've gained some
ground, but we're still

637
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:41,187
being held by the stasis field.

638
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,928
Power levels coming and going, Captain.

639
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,930
Security reports two dozen
crew still trapped below deck.

640
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,714
Life support failing.

641
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:49,369
I'm reading an energy buildup
from inside the sphere.

642
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:51,850
Spiking 10,000 degrees
Kelvin and rising.

643
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:52,981
Is it powering up weapons?

644
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,853
Reading no identifiable weapons,

645
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:57,290
but its internal temperature
is now 20,000 degrees Kelvin.

646
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,945
Divert all non-essential
power to weapons.

647
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,860
Lock on that thing's
radial axis and prepare

648
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,470
to fire photon torpedoes on my order.

649
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:04,950
Aye, sir. Arming torpedoes.

650
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,995
Captain, hold your fire.

651
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,215
I do not believe the
sphere means us any harm.

652
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,607
All evidence to the contrary.

653
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:11,870
That thing's about to destroy us.

654
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,306
It's not destroying us, Captain.

655
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:15,003
It's trying to send us a message.

656
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:17,049
We received its message.
I'm about to send our reply.

657
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:21,314
Captain, what if
Vahar'ai, my death process,

658
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,491
was triggered because
the sphere is also dying?

659
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,583
You want to run that by me again?

660
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:31,237
We Kelpiens have a defining trait

661
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,588
Hard-Wired into our DNA: empathy.

662
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,417
I can feel the sphere reaching out,

663
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,767
trying to share something
before it expires.

664
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,813
Sir, I trust Saru's feelings implicitly.

665
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:45,468
- That sphere didn't come to attack us.
- Captain,

666
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,818
I believe I have discerned
its means of communication.

667
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:50,996
Detmer, status on Spock's shuttle?

668
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,868
Exits our sensor range in six minutes.

669
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,652
Once we lose his warp signature,

670
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,437
- we won't be able to reacquire it.
- Set an intercept course.

671
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,047
I want us hauling ass
the second we break free.

672
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,657
Aye, sir.

673
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:01,832
Keep talking and make it fast.

674
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:03,573
What if the sphere

675
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,315
was not attacking our
universal translator,

676
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:09,318
but attempting to teach us its language

677
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,407
because it wants to be remembered,

678
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:13,583
to preserve its history

679
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:15,237
using Discovery,

680
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:18,327
but it cannot unless we
power down and let it in?

681
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,982
That thing snatched us out of
warp and almost gutted the ship.

682
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,418
What if we lower shields,

683
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:23,942
and that's exactly
what it needs to end us?

684
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:29,773
Computer, adjust view screen display

685
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:32,602
to ultraviolet.

686
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,865
That is the light
pattern I have been seeing

687
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,998
everywhere, repeating again

688
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:40,784
and again, generated
by the sphere's virus.

689
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,961
Computer, run the light pattern

690
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:45,572
through the universal translator.

691
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:47,791
Captain, I believe we are looking

692
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,402
at a multitude of languages

693
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:52,753
so advanced, and knowledge so vast

694
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:55,190
that it simply overloaded our system.

695
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,627
This sphere is 100,000 years old.

696
00:32:57,671 --> 00:33:00,979
Imagine what it knows, what it's seen.

697
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,415
Captain, this falls under Discovery's

698
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,807
original mission statement

699
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,287
as a science vessel.

700
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,868
Well, I'll be.

701
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:22,217
An amplified cortical implant.

702
00:33:29,268 --> 00:33:31,270
Hey, kiddo.

703
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:34,664
What's your favorite song?

704
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:36,579
What?

705
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:39,539
Your favorite song...
sing it for me.

706
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:48,330
♪ Though I'm past one
hundred thousand miles ♪

707
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:52,682
♪ I'm feeling very still

708
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:58,753
♪ And I think my spaceship
knows which way to go ♪

709
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:04,085

love her very much ♪

710
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,783
♪ She knows.

711
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:29,154
May?

712
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:34,420
You
wanted to talk to me?

713
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,030
Here I am.

714
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,772
What do you want? Who are you?

715
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,818
I'm from a species known as the JahSepp.

716
00:34:41,862 --> 00:34:45,344
We lived harmoniously until an
alien intruder began to arrive

717
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:48,042
at random intervals,

718
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,827
ravaging our ecosystem irreparably.

719
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:53,526
So, you came for help
to rid your species

720
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,397
of a destructive alien presence?

721
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,530
You are the destructive alien presence.

722
00:34:57,573 --> 00:35:01,099
The-the... the jumps?

723
00:35:02,752 --> 00:35:04,711
Discoveryâs jumps?

724
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:08,062
I broke through the
confines of the network

725
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,020
to reach you, at great risk.

726
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,761
Risk? You infected my friend.

727
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:14,112
You don't belong inside of her.

728
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,114
You fly the ship from within
the cube, I can reach you.

729
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,942
In Tilly, I found the memory
of May Ahearn, someone I knew

730
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,380
she'd be sympathetic to,
if given a second chance.

731
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,643
Once she trusted May, I
planned to persuade her

732
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:25,427
to deliver my message to you.

733
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,387
Oh, I can only ask for your forgiveness.

734
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,997
I knew better.

735
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,825
I know better.

736
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,828
I'll do whatever it takes to fix this.

737
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,830
All I ask is that you let Tilly go.

738
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:38,005
I can't.

739
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:39,789
I have other plans for her.

740
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,185
Wrong!Oh. No!

741
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,841
Tilly!

742
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:49,321
The sphere's

743
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:50,800
internal temperature is approaching

744
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:52,802
ten-to-the-sixth-power
Kelvin and rising.

745
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,369
Our weapons will just
disintegrate in that heat.

746
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,805
Solar temperatures.

747
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,546
A sign of core collapse.

748
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,201
Captain, if we are correct,

749
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:03,204
once the transmission is
complete, the sphere can die

750
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,815
knowing that it will
live on after it is gone.

751
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,645
We can choose to fulfill
our part in its destiny,

752
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:14,911
or simply let it fade away unremembered.

753
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,218
Spock's shuttle is almost
out of sensor range, sir.

754
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:20,743
Prepare to lower shields.

755
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:25,226
If this goes south,
overload the warp core

756
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,402
and eject it at the
sphere on my command.

757
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,622
Even at half the distance,
the blast will decimate it.

758
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,972
When it lets go, we
divert all power to shields

759
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,843
and try to ride the shock
wave to a safe distance.

760
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:36,237
Assuming it doesn't vaporize us first.

761
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,804
If there's even half a
chance you're correct,

762
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:40,589
I'm bound by my oath and conscience

763
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,765
not to let it vanish forever.

764
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,289
Commanders, take your stations.

765
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:47,161
I'll follow your lead.

766
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,816
Lieutenant Detmer, lower shields.

767
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,383
Aye, sir. Shields down.

768
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,305
Bryce,

769
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,350
all channels open. Owosekun,

770
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:05,005
divert all computing
resources to Communications.

771
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:07,790
Yes, Commander. Here goes nothing.

772
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,717
Transmission is downloading.

773
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,241
All library computers

774
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:24,938
are processing at 20% above maximum.

775
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,114
Whatever the sphere is saying,
we're getting all of it.

776
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:28,942
- How long until it blows?
- Seconds. Power

777
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,118
and energy levels are off the chart.

778
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:32,772
Detmer, can you put enough
distance between us in time?

779
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:35,209
Negative, sir. We're still
being locked by the stasis field.

780
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,342
Transmission complete. Detmer,
eject the warp core.

781
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,126
Computer controls not responding, sir.

782
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,127
Detonation confirmed.

783
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,607
Hard astern. Full impulse now.

784
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,138
Ah.

785
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,967
It is so beautiful.

786
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,231
The light is almost like... music.

787
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,973
Yes, it is.

788
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:03,019
I'm at a loss as to how
we're still alive to see it.

789
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,285
The sphere's stasis
field reversed polarity

790
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:10,157
a nanosecond before detonation...

791
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,334
and pushed us clear.

792
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:16,206
Its final act was to save us

793
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,513
so we could tell its story.

794
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,347
Hand me the damn torch.

795
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,666
Tilly.

796
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:41,841
Breathe. Breathe,
Tilly.

797
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:42,929
Breathe.

798
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:45,018
Breathe, breathe. Slow it down.

799
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,715
Breathe. Come on, you're okay.

800
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,501
You're still you.

801
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,024
Tilly.

802
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:54,027
Slow. Shh.

803
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,029
Stamets
to Burnham. We got Tilly.

804
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,987
She's okay.

805
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:16,354
Now it is my turn.

806
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,921
Take me to my quarters, please.

807
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,613
I left home with a handful of seeds.

808
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,704
Is this from your homeworld?

809
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:06,142
It is the blossom that marks the...

810
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:09,145
the passing of seasons on Kaminar.

811
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:15,238
Somewhere along the way,
I... I lost who I was.

812
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,111
So focused on being

813
00:40:18,154 --> 00:40:21,375
the best Kelpien in Starfleet.

814
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,683
Defined by my rank

815
00:40:24,726 --> 00:40:26,728
and uniform...

816
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:30,993
...until that is all I became.

817
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,826
You are wrong.

818
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,828
Look at what you've achieved.

819
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:43,484
You found yourself among the stars.

820
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:46,226
You found your bravery.

821
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,924
Your strength.

822
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:51,579
You've saved so many lives, Saru.

823
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,714
Including mine.

824
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,640
It is time.

825
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:17,170
In that first drawer, you
will find a Kelpien knife,

826
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:21,696
a keepsake I use to prune my flowers.

827
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,495
I need you

828
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:41,194
to... to sever my ganglia

829
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,152
and end my suffering.

830
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,719
I need your help

831
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,635
so that I can die now,

832
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,377
peacefully,

833
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,294
before the pain and
madness overtakes me.

834
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:06,132
Thank you, Michael.

835
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,583
Do we have to do this?

836
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:26,369
Is it truly inevitable?

837
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:29,677
I am sorry.

838
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:35,944
I know how hard this is for you.

839
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:38,991
How many people you've already lost.

840
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:46,694
I would do it myself, but...

841
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:49,479
I am too weak.

842
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,533
After all this time...

843
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:05,713
...after everything that we
have been through together...

844
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,239
...I realize now

845
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:13,895
that you are my family, Saru.

846
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,857
I feel the same...

847
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,859
about you.

848
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:24,514
You are the only one who knows me.

849
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,910
You replaced the
sister I had on Kaminar.

850
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,610
Siranna.

851
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:37,745
That knife was hers.

852
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:40,879
I left her

853
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:44,360
without so much as a good-bye.

854
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:48,626
You promise me...

855
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:52,934
no matter how frightening
or painful it may be...

856
00:43:52,978 --> 00:43:55,720
promise me

857
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,896
you will

858
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:01,073
mend your relationship with Spock.

859
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:05,164
If you and I can build
this type of bond,

860
00:44:05,207 --> 00:44:07,383
I'm certain you can
do the same with him.

861
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:10,691
Please.

862
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:13,694
I promise.

863
00:44:18,264 --> 00:44:22,137
Good-bye, Michael.

864
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:28,709
I love you, Saru.

865
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:39,633
Michael? What is wrong?

866
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,419
I- I bare... I barely touched it.

867
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,944
They fell out on their own.

868
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,128
I... I, uh...

869
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,217
don't understand.

870
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,436
I should be...

871
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:06,573
Your vital signs
have returned to normal.

872
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,792
How are you feeling?

873
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:11,186
I have never felt this way before.

874
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,060
Fear has always been the
governing principle of my life.

875
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:17,802
But now...

876
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:20,282
it is gone.

877
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:23,155
More than that, I feel...

878
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,897
...power.

879
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,814
My own power.

880
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:31,554
Well,

881
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:35,297
consider yourself certified
for duty, Commander.

882
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:43,610
Despite speaking 94 languages,

883
00:45:43,653 --> 00:45:47,962
there are times when
words are not enough.

884
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:56,797
Initial reports

885
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:58,799
are coming in from the science teams.

886
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:04,022
The sphere didn't just
give us its language.

887
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:07,329
We have recorded everything
it has seen and experienced

888
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,723
the last 100,000 years.

889
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,943
Its legacy.

890
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,859
And your legacy has a new chapter.

891
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:19,994
A new and deeply troubling one.

892
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,259
The Kelpien way of life

893
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:27,480
has always been oriented toward death

894
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:29,656
and the role the Ba'ul play in it.

895
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,529
My people call it "The Great Balance. "

896
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:37,490
It is our central, organizing truth.

897
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:38,970
But you proved it wrong.

898
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:40,710
Precisely.

899
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:44,279
And you asked me before
why I could not go home.

900
00:46:44,323 --> 00:46:48,718
It is because I made a
promise to Captain Georgiou

901
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:51,852
to uphold General Order 1,

902
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:55,813
not to interfere with
the destiny of my species.

903
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,511
But now,

904
00:46:58,554 --> 00:47:02,994
knowing that what my people
have accepted as the truth

905
00:47:03,037 --> 00:47:06,040
is a lie?

906
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,350
What does this mean for us?

907
00:47:11,393 --> 00:47:13,091
For my species?

908
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:15,833
My... my planet?

909
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:25,059
The war between
the Quaternary star systems

910
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,061
and the Roquar'ri Imperium
lasted a solar cent...

911
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:30,586
From the sphere?

912
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,850
The computer's translation.

913
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:35,156
It's like we've found our
galaxy's Dead Sea Scrolls.

914
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,029
Federation scientists will
be studying this for centuries

915
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,683
thanks to you and Saru.

916
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,295
I hope it was worth the cost.

917
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:46,124
Cost us nothing, sir.

918
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,387
I combed through the
sphere's sensor records

919
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:50,606
and found the last thing that it saw:

920
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,912
Spock's shuttle.

921
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:54,393
I was able to track it
beyond our sensor range.

922
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:56,917
Conn,

923
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,745
Commander Burnham is sending you

924
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,268
the coordinates of Spock's shuttle.

925
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:01,791
Plot a course, and
don't spare the horses.

926
00:48:01,835 --> 00:48:02,836
Aye, sir.

927
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:09,016
From now on,

928
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,411
I'll work to keep you clear

929
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:14,239
about whatever happens
with your brother.

930
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:17,068
Thank you, Captain, but I
have had a change of heart.

931
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:20,549
I can't abandon him.

932
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,508
No matter the mistakes that I've made,

933
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:25,598
I need my brother to know that
I will always be there for him.

934
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:27,469
No matter what.

935
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,868
We need to close the
door to the network.

936
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,130
Forever.

937
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:39,699
Just making final calculations.

938
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:42,920
Hi, hi. Hello? Hello? It's me.

939
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:46,227
Did you see that?

940
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:47,881
- See what?
- May.

941
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,536
She was there, and then she was gone.

942
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:53,060
Um...

943
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:56,716
...you might still be coming
down off your hallucinogen.

944
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:57,935
- No, I swear. I swear.
- Yeah.

945
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:00,024
No, it's natural to be paranoid

946
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:01,895
in your condition. Something
is not right.

947
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,896
Something's not right.

948
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,550
Hello?

949
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:05,768
Tilly. Hello?

950
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,248
Tilly. Hello, hello...

951
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,251
Wow.

952
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,688
Have you always been a superior being?

953
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:14,603
Hi. Hello? Hello?

954
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:17,084
Because...

955
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:18,956
the harmonics in your aura...

956
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:20,261
You know, I was thinking

957
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:23,961
the exact same thing about your aura.

958
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:25,440
What's that dust on your face?

959
00:49:25,484 --> 00:49:26,789
...dust on your face?

960
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,269
It's on yours, too.

961
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:29,096
...yours, too.

962
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,619
That tastes like...

963
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:31,881
Psilocybin?

964
00:49:31,925 --> 00:49:33,187
Psilocybin?

965
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,276
It dosed us. It dosed us.

966
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,669
Slap me really hard.

967
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:40,281
Why'd I do that?

968
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:42,501
To get me focused enough
to find the med kit.

969
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:44,982
I need to hit us both
with a shot of impedrizine

970
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,157
so we can come down.

971
00:49:48,942 --> 00:49:51,553
Now I need to give one to Tilly.

972
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:53,077
Wait a minute. Where is she?

973
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:55,383
Tilly?

974
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:57,951
Wait.

975
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,649
Oh, my God, they took her.

976
00:50:00,693 --> 00:50:02,173
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

977
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:07,395
Tilly?

978
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:09,136
No!

979
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:19,971
Ensign Sylvia Tilly is out there.

980
00:50:19,972 --> 00:50:22,941
And we have an hour to find her.

981
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,233
- You kidnapped me!
- I need your help.

982
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:29,337
Try not to blow us up.

983
00:50:31,036 --> 00:50:32,802
Don't be so worried.

984
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:36,168
Burnham to the bridge.
We have a complication.

985
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:39,188
We wont survive complications.
